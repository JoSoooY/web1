<p>
<strong>Tokyo</strong>(東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis.
It is also one of Japan's 47 <u>prefectures</u>, consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center.
The <u>Izu</u> and <u>Ogasawara</u> Islands are also part of Tokyo.
</p>
<p>Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. 
Previously a small <u>castle town</u>, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when <u>Tokugawa Ieyasu</u> established his feudal government there. 
A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's largest cities. With the Meiji <u>Restoration</u> of 1868, the <u>emperor</u> and capital moved from <u>Kyoto</u> to Edo, 
which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the <u>Great Kanto Earthquake</u> of 1923 and the air raids of 1945.
